# Introduction #

As far as this project is concerned a gadget is small, DHTML (HTML+CSS+JavaScript) based application.  Typically run inside (i.e.: on a web page) or by a browser (ex.: [Opera widgets](http://dev.opera.com/articles/widgets/)) but other user agents are possible (ex.: [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/)).

Gadgets can of course be written in other languages, such as Flash/Flex/ActionScript, a .NET family language or a Java-based language.  For the moment at least, I'm not going to consider those types of gadgets.

# List of Environments #

This is where a gadget can run.  Although some gadgets can run on _any_ web site they none-the-less depend on an API.  Some of these API's are more permissive of where they can be called from than others.

# Summary #

Since not all environments provide the same functionality gadgets don't always work the same way, but the intention is discover the limits and work-arounds of each environment.
